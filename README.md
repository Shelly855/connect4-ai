### Supported Modes

- Human vs Human
- Human vs AI (Random, Smart, Minimax, Basic ML, Minimax-Trained ML)
- AI vs AI

---

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Recommended: VS Code with the Python extension
- `scikit-learn` (required for ML agents)

> Install with:
>
> ```bash
> pip install scikit-learn
> ```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal in this project folder.
2. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```
3. Use the dropdowns to choose agents and start the game.

## Files

- `game.py` – Core game and AI logic (also launches GUI)
- `connect4_gui.py` - Handles the GUI and game interactions
- `config.py` - Board dimensions, colours, and player tokens
- `ml_agent.pkl` – ML model trained using real game data (UCI dataset)
- `ml_agent_minimax.pkl` – ML model trained using data generated from the minimax algorithm
- `performance_evaluation.py` – Simulates games between agents and collects performance data across 500+ matches
- `game_results.csv` – Raw results from each simulated game (e.g. winner, execution time, nodes expanded, etc.) generated by running `python performance_evaluation.py`
  
---

## Notes

- You can reset or restart the game at any time via the sidebar.
- Speed slider affects how quickly AI agents make their moves.
- If a minimax agent is selected, the minimax game tree is automatically generated and viewable.
